# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
The algorithm proposed works on Twitter Data, primarily it collects the tweets and then study it with
the help of different statistical computing procedures. Twitter account once registered and logged in,
needs registering the application name on Twitter API to create our application which provide us the
four legal credentials (API_key, API_secret, access_token, access_token_secret) required for
connection establishment. This contains a marked instance of a word that determine whether that
instance is positive, negative or neutral in that context. We cannot be thrown in public, communities
and opinion. The sense of the analysis of the most important are also useful in a wider range of
important social instruments after a decision declaring that it allows them to call us a glimpse into the
same subject and the ability to extract data from widely adopted in practice given social organizations
worldwide.
